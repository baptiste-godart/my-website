		   	<h3>What Are the Common Ingredients and Flavors that we use for cooking ? </h3>
		   	<p>Besides the standard spice kit of chili peppers (dried whole and powdered), garlic, ginger, and allspice, common ingredients in Indian cooking include:

			Chili peppers (dried whole and powdered)
			Mustard seeds. We are used to seeing these in grainy mustard. Their natural fieriness is tempered when they are roasted and they become nuttier in flavor. Essential in Indian cooking.
			Cumin. These small seeds have a strong, pungent aroma that lends a familiar backnote to many Indian and Mexican dishes. A little goes a long way. Also, cheese and yogurt are prominent in some vegetarian dishes like saag paneer and naan.</p>

		    <h4>Is Indian Food Healthy?</h4>
		   	<p>Indian food is relatively healthy and vegetable-forward, we propose plenty of vegetarian dishes and even vegan dishes  like okra bhajis, samosa, and dal.
